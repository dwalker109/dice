This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Notes

* Developed with Node 13. Should work with >= 10.
* If fsevent crashes on startup, delete `package-lock.json` and `node_modules`
  and install/run again - seems to be a Linux/Node 13 issue

# Running

* `npm install`
* `npm run start` and view the app on `http://localhost:3000`

# Tests

Not a complete suite of tests but an initial outline.

* `npm run test`
